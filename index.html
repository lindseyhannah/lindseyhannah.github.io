						<h4><strong> New York City </strong> is a densely populated and low lying coastal city of 8.4 million people consisting of 5 boroughs spread across peninsulas and islands. The low lying coastal topography and percentage of New York City covered with impervious surfaces (sidewalks, roads, dense built environment) increase the current risks of serious flooding.  Furthermore, the future potential for weather related flooding events is predicted to increase with an upwards trend in more severe climate related weather events and the inevitable sea level rise as a result of climate change. </h4>
						<br>

					
						<h4>Flooding in New York City occurs due to heavy storm related rain events and from hurricanes. In October of 2012, Hurricane Sandy inundated New York City with an unprecedented amount of flood water. The storm killed 53 people and injured hundreds, flooded streets, buildings and subway tunnels, and damaged billions of dollars of property and infrastructure.  </h4>

						<h4> While events with a magnitude like Sandy are not typical for NYC, the city is still highly suceptiple to flooding due to other storm related events. The Federal Emergency Managment Agency (FEMA) has identified Special Flood Hazard Areas (SFHAs) in New York City by determining the likelihood that a certain area will be innundated by water in a given year. While there are many different classifications and subclassficiations of SPHAs, the most common designations are the "100 year flood zone" and the "500 year flood zone". In coastal areas like NYC, there are also Special Wave Hazard Areas that are significant because of the addtional dangers associated with strong storm surge waves. </h4>

					<h4>Scientists predict that sea levels will continue to rise due to warming air and ocean temperatures. Storms like Hurricane Sandy will also become more frequent in the future because warmer ocean waters help to create and sustain more violent storms. Based on predicted sea levels for the year 2050, the map below shows the the future predicted 100 year and 500 year flood zones. </h4>

					<h4>Flooding in coastal areas will only worsen with increasing sea levels and stronger storm events. Future predictions for 2050 and beyond show a much larger percentage of NYC affected by 100 year and 500 year flood events, however, the true risks cannot be fully known at this time.  As better data and modeling becomes available, city planners need to account not only for current flood risks but also potential future flood risks. These predictions are critical when planning infrastructure, housing, and emergency management master plans.</h4>
